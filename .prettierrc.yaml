# Prettier intentionally doesnâ€™t support any kind of global configuration. 

# The only options that can be changed in the configuration file are:
# for more explanations and examples refer to: https://prettier.io/docs/en/options.html

trailingComma: # all | es5 | none - Print trailing commas wherever possible in multi-line comma-separated syntactic structures.
tabWidth: # int - Specify the number of spaces per indentation-level
semi: false # bool - Print semicolons at the ends of statements
singleQuote: true # bool - Use single quotes instead of double quotes

quoteProps: # as-needed | consistent | preserve - Change when properties in objects are quoted
printWidth: # int - Specify the line length that the printer will wrap on.
useTabs: # bool - Indent lines with tabs instead of spaces
jsxSingleQuote: # bool - Use single quotes instead of double quotes in JSX
bracketSpacing: # bool - Print spaces between brackets in object literals.
bracketSameLine: # bool - Put the > of a multi-line HTML (HTML, JSX, Vue, Angular) element at the end of the last line instead of being alone on the next line (does not apply to self closing elements).
arrowParens: always # always | avoid - Include parentheses around a sole arrow function parameter
rangeStart: 0 # int - Format only a segment of a file
rangeEnd: Infinity # int - Format only a segment of a file
parser: # string - Specify which parser to use


# Configuration Overrides for specific formats:
semi: false
overrides:
  - files: "*.test.js" #files is required for each override (string or array of strings)
    options:
      semi: true
  - files:
      - "*.html"
      - "legacy/**/*.js"
    options:
      tabWidth: 4
  - excludeFiles: "" #optional



# You can also add a parser to format files prettier does not recognize:
# Note: NEVER put the parser option at the top level of your configuration, ONLY use it inside overrides

overrides:
    - files: ".prettierrc"
      options:
        parser: "json"
